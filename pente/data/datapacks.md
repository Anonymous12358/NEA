# Datapacks

In addition to the built-in game of pente and its variants, it is possible to play many other games and variants using
this application. This is accomplished by defining them with datapacks. Once written, datapacks can be shared and
installed easily.

## Understanding the game structure

Datapacks work by defining features that affect the game's rules:
- Rules define what happens after a player places their stone for the turn, eg capturing stones or winning the game
- Restrictions define which moves are illegal
- Scores are numbers tracked for each player, and can be modified by the application of rules and checked as part of
rules and conditions

Datapacks can also define the dimensions of the board.
